		     Part and Phase in Development of Programmner-defined functions
		==============================================
=>The reason for developing Programmner-defined functions is that to perform some operation  and provided re-usability.
=>While we are defining the programmer-defined functions, we must ensure that there must exists 2 parts.
			a) Function Definition
			b) Function Calls
=>A perticular Function Definition exists Only Once and for one function definition we can have multiple function calls.
=>"For Every Function Call, there must exists a Function Definition otherwise we get Error"
=>Function Definition will execute provided when we call otherwise function definition will not execute.

=>We know that functions are meant for performing Operations and code-re-usability and it can do  the following
			a) Taking INPUT
			d) PROCESSING the input
			c) Giving the OUTPUT
here (a),(b) and (c) are phases in Functions.
